# ShowGrid

[ShowGrid](https://theshowgrid.com) - A single purpose web app to see IMDb ratings of all episodes of a TV show in a nice table. Non-commercial; no signup or any other nonsense.

Though it's not a mobile app, you can use "**Add to home screen**" option from browsers to create an app like shortcut right on your screen, if you use it often.

> Currently, the project is not open source. This repo exists to track user submitted issues/feature requests.
